# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Purchase Behavior Analysis using Excel Dashboard

This project analyzes a fictional dataset of potential bike buyers. Using Excel, I explored how demographic and lifestyle factors influence the likelihood of purchasing a bike.

- **Feature Engineering:** Added age brackets.
- **Pivot Tables:** Created summaries of income, bike purchases, and demographic data.
- **Dashboard:** Built an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and charts (best viewed in Excel).
